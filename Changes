    https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=121002
  - Typo fixes (Paul Howarth)
  - Rework test suite, move author tests below xt/

0.19 2017-03-30
  - Make error message more like the original Perl error message (haarg)
  - Makefile.PL overhaul (by Abzal Serekov)
  - Generate README.md

0.18 2014-08-30
  - Eliminate segfault on Perl 5.8 (by Graham Knop, Karen Etheridge, RT 98207)
  - Only add the @INC hook once (by Graham Knop, RT #91857)
  - Updated documentation

0.17 2009-01-18
  - Made license explicit in the metadata (for those versions
    of EU:MM that support it)
  ! Changed module comparison from using a regular expression
    to string equality. That means that ugly actions at a distance
    by matching substrings shouldn't happen.

0.16 2008-10-20
  - Add a test that exhibits the "redefined" warnings upon disallowing
    and then reallowing a module
  - Fixed the code so no more warnings get issued. [RT#40065]

0.15 2007-10-21
  - Now really restored compatibility of the tests with Perl 5.005,
    using lexical filehandles does not work under 5.005...
  . No functional changes, no upgrade is necessary

0.14 2007-10-20
  - Hopefully restored compatibility of the tests with Perl 5.005 this time, reported by SREZIC
  . No functional changes, no upgrade is necessary

0.13 2007-10-20
  - Restored compatibility of the tests with Perl 5.005, reported by SREZIC
  . No functional changes, no upgrade is necessary

0.12 2007-10-20
  - Fixed RT [rt.cpan.org #24735], reported by Slaven Rezic
    This seems to have been some really weird interaction or maybe
    eating of $@.

0.11 2007-08-19
  - File::Slurp is now no prerequisite anymore - the test
    requiring it is now optional

0.10 2007-08-04
  - Added missing File::Slurp prerequisite. Thanks to ANDK and
    the CPAN smoke testers to alert me to this
  - No functional changes. No upgrade from 0.09 is necessary.

0.09 2006-12-31
  - Added more consistency tests
  - Added Jerrad Pierce to the list of those
    who mentioned the command line use. I forgot
    the usage NUFFIN had given, so both were
    genuinely new to me.

0.08 2006-12-29
  - Removed superfluous File::Temp usage from module

0.07 2006-12-29
  - No more inline pod tests
  - No code changes since 0.06

0.06 2003-03-20
  - fixed the inline test pod
  - Now needs Test::Pod 0.95 (or skips the pod test)

0.03 2003-02-17
  - Released on CPAN
  - Fixes so the pod for the fake module doesn't appear
    in the main pod.

0.02 2003-02-16
  - Released on CPAN

0.01  Sat Feb 15 21:14:45 2003

    -Xn Test::Without::Module
